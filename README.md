# Portfolio
This project involves the creation of a personal profile site to showcase information and projects of Petar Vidovic.
The site was created using a combination of html and CSS along with some personal images. 
The site is capable of being viewed on smaller screensizes and has clickable links within text that take the viewer to various identified webpages.

Links to deployed sites: https://prvapalacinka.github.io/Portfolio/ and https://github.com/prvapalacinka/Portfolio
